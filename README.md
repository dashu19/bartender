This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Bartender

Deployed at [https://github.com/dashu19/bartender](https://github.com/dashu19/bartender)

This is a small React app I made to learn React, web development (Using HTML, CSS, JS), and using JS to make API calls.

In brief, the app fetches data using the Wikipedia API, parses through the data, and then presents an info card about a random cocktail for the user.

My main challenges were understanding the life cycle of a React app, and understanding the asynchronous nature of some functions, especially fetches.
